FINAL DECISION
======================================================================
Type: APPROVED
SADE Message: APPROVED
Explanation: Approved: Wind is well within both MFC and demonstrated operational envelope (steady 5.2 kt, gust 8.0 kt, MFC max wind 19.4 kt, demo max 15.0 kt). Payload (2.0 kg) is below manufacturer maximum (15.9 kg). No unresolved high severity or follow-up incidents. All required high severity incidents have been resolved as confirmed by Claims Agent.
