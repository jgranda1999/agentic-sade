FINAL DECISION
======================================================================
Type: APPROVED
SADE Message: APPROVED
Explanation: Approved: Based on the Environment Agent, current wind is steady 5.2 kt with gusts 8.0 kt (LOW wind risk) and remains well within the demonstrated envelope (steady=15.0 kt, gust=15.0 kt) reported by the Reputation Agent. Based on the Reputation Agent, there is a historical HIGH risk signal due to an unresolved high-severity incident prefix (0011) and multiple 0100/0101 incidents; however, the Claims Agent verified documented follow-up/mitigation and satisfied the required action RESOLVE_HIGH_SEVERITY_INCIDENTS, with no unresolved incident prefixes and no unsatisfied actions remaining. With claims satisfied and wind not near/exceeding the envelope, entry is approved.
